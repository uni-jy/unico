# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

The `main` branch receives security fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Please do not open a public issue for vulnerabilities that may expose:

- NetEase Cloud Music cookies
- API keys
- Volcengine Ark / Seed API credentials
- `.env` contents
- playlist dumps or listener portraits
- generated private audio files

Report privately to the repository owner through GitHub security advisories when available. If advisories are not enabled, contact the maintainer directly and include:

- A short description of the issue
- Steps to reproduce
- Impact and affected files
- Whether any credential or user data may have been exposed

## Handling Sensitive Data

Unico ignores `.env`, `data/`, and `cache/` by default. If you fork or deploy the project, keep those paths out of public repositories and backups that are not meant to hold private data.

The default model is Seed 2.1 Pro through the Volcengine Ark OpenAI-compatible endpoint. Keep `SEED_API_KEY` (or its `VOLCENGINE_API_KEY` alias) in local environment configuration only.
